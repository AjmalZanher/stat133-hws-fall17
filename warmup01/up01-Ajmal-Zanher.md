*Review Questions:* <br>

1.  What things were hard, even though you saw them in class?
    I kept on forgetting the little aspects which ended up causing the program to bug, this includes but is not limited to, forgetting to put quotes around my small.<br>

2.  What was easy(-ish) even though we haven't done it in class?
    Being about to figure out the basics of being hyperlinking and linking images the easiest of all the unknown tasks.<br>

3.  Was this the first time you were using markdown? If yes, how do you feel about it?
    No, I have used this before.<br>

4.  If you have used markdown before, was there something new you learned while doing this assignment? This is not my first time using markdown, however, it is my second time. I have to admit that being able to complete the alloted tasks gives the user a great sense of satisfaction and the process is exceptionally smooth.<br>

5.  Did you need help to complete the assignment? If so, what kind of help? Who helped you?
    I need to have a list of RMarkdown functions. I was able to recieve this help by googling and downloading files which had a comprehensive list of RMarkdown functions.

6.  How much time did it take to complete this HW?
    The homework took me about an hour to complete. <br>

7.  What was the most time consuming part? Carefully matching the Math equations with the LaTeX syntax was, by far, the most time consuming aspect of this homework. <br>
